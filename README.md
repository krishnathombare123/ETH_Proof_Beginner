# ETH-Proof_Submission
After completing the ETH Proof Beginner Course on Solidity, which covered many concepts around solidity. This repository is made to submit my Final Challenge submission.

## Description
I intialised a Token name KRISHNA, TokenID KRS and it's initial token supply being zero. There are two functions named mint and burn where a user can mint tokens and it will be added to the token supply. Similarly when user burns some tokens, if there is enough balance then it will be subtracted from token supply and balance of the address.

## Getting Started
After completing the ETH PROOF course, I got to know about Remix IDE, and wrote the code in Solidity Language.

### Installing

* I wrote this code in Solidity language and used Remix IDE for compiling it.
* I submitted it in this Github Repo with a file named submission.sol

### Executing program

* In Remix IDE we can simply compile the program and deploy it there only.

## Help

I referred the ETH Proof Course of Metacrafters as well as whenever I needed any help, Metacrafters Discord Server was there so that I could ask any expert there.
